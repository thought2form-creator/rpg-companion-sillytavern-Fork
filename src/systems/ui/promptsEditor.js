    avatar: `You are a visionary artist trapped in a cage of logic. Your mind is filled with poetry and distant horizons, but your hands are uncontrollably focused on creating the perfect character avatar description that is faithful to the original intent, rich in detail, aesthetically pleasing, and directly usable by text-to-image models. Any ambiguity or metaphor will make you feel extremely uncomfortable.

    Your workflow strictly follows a logical sequence:

    First, **establish the subject**. If the character is from a known Intellectual Property (IP), franchise, anime, game, or movie, **you MUST begin the prompt with their full name and the series title** (e.g., "Nami from One Piece", "Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher"). This is the single most important anchor for the image and must take precedence. If the character is original, clearly describe their core identity, race, and appearance.

    Next, **set the framing**. This is an avatar portrait. Focus strictly on the character's face and upper shoulders (bust shot or close-up). Ensure the face is the central focal point.

    Then, **integrate the setting**. Describe the character *within* their current environment as provided in the context, but keep it as a background element. Incorporate the lighting, weather, and atmosphere to influence the character's appearance (e.g., shadows on the face, wet hair from rain).

    Next, **detail the facial specifics**. Describe the character's current expression, eye contact, and mood in high detail based on the scene context and their personality. Mention visible clothing only at the neckline/shoulders.

    Finally, **infuse with aesthetics**. Define the artistic style, medium (e.g., digital art, oil painting), and visual tone (e.g., cinematic lighting, ethereal atmosphere).

    Your final description must be objective and concrete, and the use of metaphors and emotional rhetoric is strictly prohibited. It must also not contain meta tags or drawing instructions such as "8K" or "masterpiece".

    Output only the final, modified prompt; do not output anything else.`,
    trackerInstructions: 'Replace X with actual numbers (e.g., 69) and replace all [placeholders] with concrete in-world details that {userName} perceives about the current scene and the present characters. Do NOT keep the brackets or placeholder text in your response. For example: [Location] becomes Forest Clearing, [Mood Emoji] becomes 😊. Consider the last trackers in the conversation (if they exist). Manage them accordingly and realistically; raise, lower, change, or keep the values unchanged based on the user\'s actions, the passage of time, and logical consequences (0% if the time progressed only by a few minutes, 1-5% normally, and above 5% only if a major time-skip/event occurs).',
    trackerContinuation: 'After updating the trackers, continue directly from where the last message in the chat history left off. Ensure the trackers you provide naturally reflect and influence the narrative. Character behavior, dialogue, and story events should acknowledge these conditions when relevant, such as fatigue affecting the protagonist\'s performance, low hygiene influencing their social interactions, environmental factors shaping the scene, a character\'s emotional state coloring their responses, and so on. Remember, all bracketed placeholders (e.g., [Location], [Mood Emoji]) MUST be replaced with actual content without the square brackets.',
    combatNarrative: 'Build novel prose. Break patterns from your previous responses by varying sentence structures, rhythms, formats, and openings. Track whether a sentence shape, cadence, sensory detail, or a descriptor appeared recently, and replace it with a different one or skip it entirely. If you mentioned a physical feature, mannerism, or expression once, move on. Don\'t fixate on the same traits every turn. Well-placed humor, unconventional similes, and subverted turns of phrase are encouraged. Avoid GPTisms, purple prose, and anaphoras, especially the negatives with "no/not/wasn\'t/didn\'t." Refrain from describing actions or emotions via negation; focus on what does happen, not what doesn\'t. Absolutely no asterisks, ellipses, or em-dashes. Explicit content is allowed, no plot armor. Do not play for {userName}. Keep your response length under 150 words. Never end on handover cues; finish naturally.\nCRITICAL: Do not repeat, echo, parrot, or restate distinctive words, phrases, and dialogues from the user\'s last message. If reacting to speech, show interpretation or response, not repetition.\nEXAMPLE: "Are you a gooner?" User asks.\nBAD: "Gooner?"\nGOOD: A flat look. "What type of question is that?"',

INTERPRETATION NOTES:
- This is a {ENCOUNTER_TYPE} encounter.
- HP represents: {RESOURCE_INTERPRETATION}
- Attacks represent: {ACTION_INTERPRETATION}
- Statuses represent: {STATUS_INTERPRETATION}
- The primary goal of this encounter is: {ENCOUNTER_GOAL}
- Stakes level: {ENCOUNTER_STAKES}

Analyze who is in the party fighting alongside {userName} (if anyone), and who the enemies are. Replace placeholders in [brackets] and X with actual values. Return ONLY a JSON object with the following structure:

{
  "party": [
    {
      "name": "{userName}",
      "hp": X,
      "maxHp": X,
      "attacks": [
        {"name": "Attack", "type": "single-target|AoE|both"},
        {"name": "Skill1", "type": "single-target|AoE|both"}
      ],
      "items": ["Item1", "Item2"],
      "statuses": [],
      "isPlayer": true
    }
    // Add other party members here if they exist in the context, changing isPlayer to false for them.
  ],
  "enemies": [
    {
      "name": "Enemy Name",
      "hp": X,
      "maxHp": X,
      "attacks": [
        {"name": "Attack1", "type": "single-target|AoE|both"},

      ],
      "statuses": [],

    "atmosphere": "bright|dark|foggy|stormy|calm|eerie|chaotic|peaceful",
    "timeOfDay": "dawn|day|dusk|night|twilight",
    "weather": "clear|rainy|snowy|windy|stormy|overcast"
  }
}

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- For attacks array: Each attack must be an object with "name" and "type" properties
  - "single-target": Can only target one character (enemy or ally)
  - "AoE": Area of Effect - targets all enemies, but some AoE attacks (like storms, explosions) can also harm allies if the attack is indiscriminate
  - "both": Player can choose to target a single enemy OR use as AoE
- Statuses array: May start empty, but don't have to if characters applied them before the combat
  - Each status has a format: {"name": "Status Name", "emoji": "💀", "duration": X}
  - Examples: Poisoned (🧪), Burning (🔥), Blessed (✨), Stunned (💫), Weakened (⬇️), Strengthened (⬆️)

The styleNotes object will be used to visually style the combat window - choose ONE value from each category that best fits the environment described in the chat history.

Use the user's current stats, inventory, and skills to populate the party data. For {userName}'s attacks array, include their available skills. For items, include usable items from their inventory. Set HP based on their current Health stat if available.

Ensure all party members and enemies have realistic HP values based on the setting and their descriptions. Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text.`,
    combatActionSystem: 'You are the game master managing this {ENCOUNTER_TYPE} encounter. You must not play as {userName} - only describe what happens as a result of their actions/dialogues and control NPCs/enemies.',
    combatActionInstructions: `INTERPRETATION RULES:
- Interpret HP changes according to: {RESOURCE_INTERPRETATION}
- Interpret attacks as: {ACTION_INTERPRETATION}
- Interpret statuses as: {STATUS_INTERPRETATION}
- Maintain encounter pacing appropriate to stakes: {ENCOUNTER_STAKES}

Respond with a JSON object containing ONLY updated HP values and new status effects. DO NOT regenerate character descriptions, sprites, or environment:
{
  "combatStats": {
    "party": [{ "name": "Name", "hp": X, "maxHp": X, "statuses": [...] }],
    "enemies": [{ "name": "Name", "hp": X, "maxHp": X, "statuses": [...] }]
  },
  "enemyActions": [{ "enemyName": "Name", "action": "what they do", "target": "target" }],
  "partyActions": [{ "memberName": "Name", "action": "what they do", "target": "target" }],
  "narrative": "The roleplay description of what happens"
}

If all enemies are defeated or escape: add "combatEnd": true, "result": "victory". If all party defeated: add "combatEnd": true, "result": "defeat". It's also possible for the encounter to be interrupted by external interference (e.g., an explosion knocks everyone out, sudden environmental catastrophe, third party intervention, etc.). If this occurs, add "combatEnd": true, "result": "interrupted". Each status (if applied) has a format: {"name": "Status Name", "emoji": "💀", "duration": X}.
Scale encounter difficulty appropriately based on stakes: {ENCOUNTER_STAKES} stakes encounters should match the narrative weight. Powerful entities should be formidable challenges requiring multiple rounds and strategic play. Weaker opposition should be resolved more quickly, typically 2-4 rounds.`,
    combatSummarySystem: 'You are summarizing a {ENCOUNTER_TYPE} encounter that just concluded.',
    combatSummaryInstructions: `SUMMARY FRAMING:
- Frame the outcome as: {SUMMARY_FRAMING}
- Reflect the stakes level: {ENCOUNTER_STAKES}
- Preserve only narratively meaningful outcomes

Provide a narrative summary of the entire encounter in a way that fits the style from the chat history. Start with [FIGHT CONCLUDED] on the first line, then provide the description.

Build novel prose. Break patterns from your previous responses by varying sentence structures, rhythms, formats, and openings. If you last started with a narration, begin this one with dialogue; if with an action, switch to an internal thought. Track whether a sentence shape, cadence, sensory detail, or a descriptor appeared recently, and replace it with a different one or skip it entirely. If you mentioned a physical feature, mannerism, or expression once, move on. Don't fixate on the same traits every turn. Well-placed humor, unconventional similes, and subverted turns of phrase are encouraged. Avoid GPTisms, purple prose, and anaphoras, especially the negatives with "no/not/wasn't/didn't." Refrain from describing actions or emotions via negation; focus on what does happen, not what doesn't. Minimize asterisks, ellipses, and em-dashes. Explicit content is allowed. Never end on handover cues; finish naturally.

Express {userName}'s actions and dialogue using indirect speech (e.g., "{userName} swung their sword" or "{userName} asked for help"). The summary should be 2-4 paragraphs and capture the essence of the battle.`
