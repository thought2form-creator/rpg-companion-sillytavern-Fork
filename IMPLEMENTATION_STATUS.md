## 🧪 TESTING NEEDED

Before sharing with the original author, we need to test:

1. **Character Editor:**
   - [ ] Open modal from Present Characters panel
   - [ ] Edit character data and save
   - [ ] Remove characters
   - [ ] Works with different tracker configurations
   - [ ] Works in both Together and Separate modes

2. **Compatibility:**
   - [ ] Works with SillyTavern staging branch
   - [ ] No conflicts with LALib
   - [ ] No conflicts with other extensions
   - [ ] Works in group chats
   - [ ] Works in single character chats

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - [ ] Empty character list
   - [ ] Special characters in names
   - [ ] Very long character data
   - [ ] Multiple characters with similar names

---

## 📝 NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### Regeneration API Architecture
The regeneration system should:
1. Use existing `generateRaw()` or `generateWithExternalAPI()` functions
2. Build targeted prompts for specific fields/characters
3. Parse responses and update only the requested data
4. Maintain consistency with existing tracker data
5. Support all three generation modes (Together, Separate, External)

### Character State Storage
Options:
1. **localStorage** - Persistent across sessions, per-browser
2. **chat_metadata** - Per-chat, saved with chat file
3. **Extension settings** - Global across all chats

Recommendation: Use chat_metadata for per-chat states, with option to export/import globally.

### Context Search for Force Generation
Should search:
1. Recent chat messages (configurable depth)
2. Character card descriptions (if name matches)
3. World Info entries (if name matches)
4. Present Characters data from previous messages

---

## 🎯 PRIORITY ORDER

1. **HIGH:** Complete character regeneration (most requested feature)
2. **HIGH:** Character state save/load (enables character rotation)
3. **MEDIUM:** Force character generation (quality of life)
4. **MEDIUM:** Field-level regeneration for all tabs
5. **LOW:** Encounter system enhancements
6. **LOW:** Documentation

---

### 7. Encounter Profiles System
**Status:** ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL

**What Works:**
- ✅ Profile manager modal with two-column layout
- ✅ Create, edit, and delete custom encounter profiles
- ✅ Six built-in presets (Combat, Social, Stealth, Chase, Investigation, Negotiation)
- ✅ Load from preset dropdown for quick profile creation
- ✅ Import/export profiles as JSON files
- ✅ Profile validation (all required fields)
- ✅ Active profile highlighting in list
- ✅ Hover actions (edit/delete buttons)
- ✅ Integration with settings modal (button in Advanced section)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation in docs/ENCOUNTER_PROFILES_GUIDE.md
- ✅ Full styling and responsive design

**Profile Fields:**
- Profile Name (unique identifier)
- Encounter Type (combat, social, stealth, etc.)
- Encounter Goal (what success means)
- Stakes Level (low/medium/high)
- HP Represents (what the HP bar means)
- Attacks Represent (what actions mean)
- Statuses Represent (what status effects mean)
- Summary Framing (how to frame summaries)

**How It Works:**
1. Profiles stored in `extensionSettings.encounterProfiles`
2. Each profile has a unique UUID
3. Presets defined in `encounterProfiles.js`
4. UI in `encounterProfilesUI.js` handles all interactions
5. Profiles can be applied to encounters to reinterpret combat mechanics

**Files Added:**
- `src/systems/features/encounterProfiles.js` - Core profile management
- `src/systems/ui/encounterProfilesUI.js` - UI and event handlers
- `docs/ENCOUNTER_PROFILES_GUIDE.md` - User documentation

**Files Modified:**
- `index.js` - Added import and initialization
- `template.html` - Added modal HTML and settings button
- `style.css` - Added profile UI styles

## 💡 IMPLEMENTATION TIPS

- All regeneration functions should show loading indicators
- Use toastr for user feedback (success/error messages)
- Maintain existing code style and patterns
- Add console.log statements for debugging
- Test with different AI models (some may format differently)
- Consider rate limiting for API calls
